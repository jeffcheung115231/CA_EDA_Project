# EDA Mini Project - README

## Project Title
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Data Analyst Jobs Dataset

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques on the Data Analyst Jobs dataset obtained from Kaggle. Through analysis and visualization, we aim to gain insights into the job market for data analysts, with a focus on helping individuals in need of employment find suitable job opportunities.

## Introduction
In this project, we have chosen to explore the Data Analyst Jobs dataset created by picklesueat, which contains over 2000 job listings for data analyst positions. The dataset includes various features such as salary estimates, job locations, company ratings, and job descriptions. Our goal is to perform EDA on this dataset and extract meaningful information that can assist job seekers in their search for employment.

## Dataset Description
The Data Analyst Jobs dataset contains detailed information about data analyst job listings, including salary estimates, job locations, company ratings, job descriptions, and more. The dataset was created by picklesueat and is available on Kaggle. It provides a comprehensive view of the job market for data analysts, allowing us to analyze and understand the available opportunities.

## Findings
During the EDA process, we conducted various analyses and visualizations on the Data Analyst Jobs dataset. Here are some of the key findings:

1. Salary Analysis:
   - We examined the salary estimates for data analyst positions and analyzed the distribution of salaries.
   - We identified factors that influence salary variations, such as job experience, location, and company ratings.

2. Job Locations and Availability:
   - We explored the geographical distribution of data analyst jobs to identify regions with the highest demand.
   - We analyzed the availability of job opportunities in different locations and provided insights into potential job markets.

3. Company Ratings and Job Descriptions:
   - We investigated the relationship between company ratings and job descriptions to understand the preferences of employers.
   - We analyzed the most common skills and qualifications mentioned in job descriptions to guide job seekers in enhancing their profiles.

## Challenges and Limitations
Throughout the project, we encountered several challenges and limitations, including:

1. Data Accuracy:
   - We acknowledge that the dataset's accuracy relies on the information provided by job listings and may contain errors or inconsistencies.
   - We discuss the steps taken to handle missing or unreliable data and ensure the reliability of our analysis.

2. COVID-19 Impact:
   - The dataset covers a specific timeframe during the pandemic, which may have influenced job market dynamics.
   - We consider the potential impact of the pandemic on job availability and provide insights with this context in mind.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our EDA on the Data Analyst Jobs dataset offers valuable insights into the job market for data analysts, particularly in the context of individuals seeking employment opportunities during challenging times. By analyzing salary estimates, job locations, company ratings, and job descriptions, we aim to help job seekers hone their job search strategies and increase their chances of finding suitable employment.
